    "# Robust Kalman filtering for vehicle tracking\n",

    "We will try to pinpoint the location of a moving vehicle with high accuracy from noisy sensor data. We'll do this by modeling the vehicle state as a discrete-time linear dynamical system. Standard **Kalman filtering** can be used to approach this problem when the sensor noise is assumed to be Gaussian. We'll use **robust Kalman filtering** to get a more accurate estimate of the vehicle state for a non-Gaussian case with outliers.\n",

    "A discrete-time linear dynamical system consists of a sequence of state vectors $x_t \\in \\mathbf{R}^n$, indexed by time $t \\in \\lbrace 0, \\ldots, N-1 \\rbrace$ and dynamics equations\n",

    "\n",
    "Given $A$, $B$, $C$, and $y_t$ for $t = 0, \\ldots, N-1$, the goal is to estimate $x_t$ for $t = 0, \\ldots, N-1$.\n",

Note that since we have no observation $y_{N}$, $x_N$ is only constrained via $x_{N} = Ax_{N-1} + Bw_{N-1}$, which is trivially resolved when $w_{N-1} = 0$ and $x_{N} = Ax_{N-1}$. We maintain this vestigial constraint only because it offers a concise problem statement.\n",
